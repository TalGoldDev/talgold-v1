==========================================
My personal website, version 1. Build from scratch using React.js & CSS.
website design is based on Cassidy's (Cassidy Williams) own personal design.

## How it's built

### Rotating Images
i've created a simple react component to hold an img list and
set an interval timer to update once every 3 seconds to the next item in the array.

### Expending Content
developed a component which gets notified and updates the bio information content on click of the buttons above.

## The Design
I wanted a design which is simple, clean & fast-loading.

## Future plans
for now I am happy with the site, will probably add more animations & small changes as I see fit.
